How does the damage decline with distance?

Even though there are some source out there that claim otherwise, the formula IPAS is applying resembles the logic of Ingress out there.
Damage does not decline linear or quadratic, but in "steps".

Like the circles on an archer's target around the bull's eye, the damage of a burster is declining in circles.

This means, depending on the burster fired, it makes no difference if your target is 3 or 8 meters away as long as the target is within the same circle
