Ingress Portal Attack Simulator

This simulator lets you plan an attack on an enemy portal. It tries to simulate the damage of your bursters, depending on the position and level.

As there are some game mechanisms not fully analysed yet, you can switch between different calculation methods regarding shield influence and damage reduction due to distance.

Currently working:

- rendering of the resos in level's color,
- reso indicators on the left
- Change distance of the resos by left/right clicking on the distance (e.g. 24 m)
- dragndrop resos
