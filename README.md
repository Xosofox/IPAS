Ingress Portal Attack Simulator

This simulator lets you plan an attack on an enemy portal. It tries to simulate the damage of your bursters, depending on the position and level.

As there are some game mechanisms not fully analysed yet, you can switch between different calculation methods regarding shield influence and damage reduction due to distance.

You can use it online on http://ipas.graphracer.com
